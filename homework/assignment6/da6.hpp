File Name: tsmarray.hpp
Current Version: 7
File Function: 
    To serve as an array of a client-defined type with all of the generic container functionality
    So it can interact with the STL library functions. 

Version History:
- v7:
    - Updated array to template with user defined type
    - Wrote operators, copy, const copy, move
    - Wrote functions resize, insert, swap, and erase
    - Wrote in function guarantees, preconditions, and asserts
    - Program successfully runs using tmsarray_test.hpp 
        - This demonstrates that the code written is written well enough to serve as a generic container.
